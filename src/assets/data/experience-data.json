I already used multiple networks during university but this time I explicitly learned about local and global differential privacy and federated and encrypted learning techniques."

The project was to develop three separate touchscreen applications that are part of the visitor information center for the new Western Sydney Airport.<br/><br/>Together with my colleague, we implemented these apps in the Vue,js framework based on some beautifulÂ templates from the design team. Completing the static input with some nice transitions and animations put the cherry on the cake."

So, I spent a year in Australia where I traveled along the east coast all the way between the Daintree rainforest and Melbourne. Nevertheless, my favorite place was Tasmania because of its versatile nature and especially relaxed animals."

After creating a new GUI with optimised workflows I also participated in more functional features, e.g. image processing or data export. Together in this team, we evolved our collaborational coding skills in respect of versioning, clean code, frequent committs, and of course... comments."

From MVC, CRUD, and DRY principles to relational databases with MySql and designs with HAML and SASS. Additionally, I designed an App version for the web platform."

Sometimes these fields are touching hands and generate interesting projects."

While some things change I still read comics and books, and play video games but not that much that I used to.<br/><br/>After completing my B.A. in Architecture and working for some years in an Architectural office, I already had enough and wanted a change. Since I became more and more interested in the software I used in my Architerual work, I wanted to dive deeper into it and decided to study again.<br/><br/>This time, I decided to study Computervisualistics and I'm so glad that I started over!"
