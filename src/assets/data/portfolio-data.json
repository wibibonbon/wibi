After preprocessing and testing different machine learning algorithms an accuracy of 74% was achieved for a blood classification of all 24 time classes. Merging classes into 8 viable time regions even scored 85%.</br>For image capturing I used ROS and C++. Analyzation and Machine Learning algorithms were applied via Python with SciPy and PyTorch libraries."
